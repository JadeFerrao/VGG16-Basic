# VGG16-Basic

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of a deep learning model for image classification/regression tasks.

## Installation
Ensure you have Python 3.6+ installed. Clone the repository and install the required packages using the following command on collab:
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Model Built from Scratch Using Rooms Dataset
1. *Data Preparation*: The rooms dataset includes images of various room types. Data augmentation techniques were used to increase the dataset size.
2. *Model Architecture*: The model is built from scratch using the VGG-16 architecture with modifications to suit the room classification task.
3. *Training*: The model was trained using the prepared dataset for 10 epochs with a batch size of *.

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 56% on the rooms dataset.
